Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies-ladies and gentlemen

And I always FIND, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for US to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you CAN

She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't KNOW what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on YOU
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And, I always find
Yeah, I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
Then, run away
Babe, I got a plan
Run away as fast you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
Why can't she just run away
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

24 7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you can leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off

Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
EVERY bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

NEVER was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did DAMAGE
'Cause the look IN your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And, I always find, yeah, I always find SOMETHIN' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can
