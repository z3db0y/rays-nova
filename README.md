From the ashes, [Rays] client rises again. Despite the censorship, the hate, the prejudice - we shall dominate.  
I like to think of myself as the Kanye West of Krunker, but I will never be him; so enjoy this little gift I'm giving you.  
And they can't accuse shit this time, for this project is open-source. So fuck Yendis, fuck FRVR, I hope they all burn in hell.

## Installing

As [Rays] Nova is currently in its alpha testing stage, you can only run the client from its source.

-   Clone this repo.
-   Run `yarn install` (preferred) or `npm i`.
-   To start, run `npm start`.

## Bugs
